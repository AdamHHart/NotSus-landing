Welcome to NotSus ("we," "our," or "us"), a safe browsing and learning platform designed for children and families in British Columbia and across Canada. By creating an account and using our services, you ("you," "parent," "guardian," or "child user") agree to these Terms & Conditions ("Terms").
If you are under the age of 19 (the age of majority in BC), you must have a parent or guardian review and accept these Terms on your behalf.
Services Provided
Our app integrates safe, educational websites such as Khan Academy, Scratch, TED-Ed, IXL, EdX, Canva (free), TinkerCAD, VS Code, and Blender. We provide:
A safe browser wrapper with filtering to block unsafe or addictive sites.
Tracking tools so parents can monitor their child's educational activity and projects.
Subscription services with a 14-day free trial, then monthly or yearly billing options.

Children may create their own accounts with an email. Parental oversight and consent are required but not enforced by us.
You agree to provide accurate information (name, email, and age) when registering.

Personal Data: name, email, and login credentials
Usage Data: browsing activity, app usage logs, and project history.
We use this data to:
Provide core app functions (tracking projects, dashboards for parents).
Improve safety by monitoring activity and blocking harmful content.
Manage subscriptions and payments.
We comply with:

After the trial, a subscription is required for full access (monthly or yearly).

Content Filtering & Third-Party Sites

We integrate third-party educational websites. Each of these has its own Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policies. We are not responsible for their content or services.
Parents are responsible for reviewing third-party site policies before allowing children to use them.
Parents can manually add sites themselves, and maintain responsibility over this right.

Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law:
We are not responsible for any damages, losses, or harm resulting from use of third-party websites, downtime, or technical errors.
Our service is provided "as is" without warranties of uninterrupted access or error-free operation.
Errors and issues can be reported through the Feedback portal (on the Dashboard) or by emailing contact@notsus.net

Parental Responsibilities
Parents/guardians are responsible for supervising their child's use of the app.
Parents should regularly review their child's dashboard and activity reports.

Termination of Accounts
We may suspend or terminate accounts if:
Terms are violated.
Subscriptions are unpaid.
